# Detecting-Emotional-Contagion-in-OSS-Projects
In this paper, propose a simple model that determines the presence of emotional contagion, negative or positive, in an open source project in order to enrich the set of tools used to help the developers.

Abstract: - In recent times, due to an increase of open source software working models, the behaviour and emotional affective state of
developers are becoming increasingly relevant as a subject of research in the software engineering community. One important aspect of
such research is emotional contagion: the phenomenon by which the affective state of an individual is transferred to another one through
communications. In this paper, propose a simple model that determines the presence of emotional contagion, negative or positive, in an
open source project in order to enrich the set of tools used to help the developers.

This paper is a part of the thesis: EMOTIONAL CONTAGION IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE COLLABORATIONS
